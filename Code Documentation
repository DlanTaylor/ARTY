-Work with Bluetooth, 2 motors, and 1 L293D chip

/*Set up the input, output, and enable pins for L293D chip
*put enable pins to High to activatie the chip
*and set up Bluetooth communication (UART) to 9600 Baudrate
*/

void setup()

/*
*Receive command from cellphone or other Bluetooth controller (L, R, F, S)
*L-left, R-right, F-forward, S-stop
*Once command received, send out action to the output pins
*Send the current action as a message to the controller
*Use flag to indicate if the action has been done, so we don't get 
*into dead loop, ie, keep sending "turn right"

-Work with Speaker, Arduino, will add as we go (ie.budget)

#setup Speaker
def speaker():

	return data

#setup GPIO (will need to change the function name based on output pins)
def gpio_output():
	
	return data

#setup bluetooth
def bluetooth_receive_transmission():

	return data


#main code body

#get the bluetooth address
#open socket to listen for commands
#if received command or sensor values, speaker will output the message
#use flag to indicate the action was done, so no dead loop (ie. speaker 
#repeat messages)
#close bluetooth socket
