-Work with Bluetooth, 2 motors, and 1 L293D chip

/*Set up the input, output, and enable pins for L293D chip
*put enable pins to High to activatie the chip
*and set up Bluetooth communication (UART) to 9600 Baudrate

/*
*Receive command from cellphone or other Bluetooth controller (L, R, F, S)
*L-left, R-right, F-forward, S-stop
*Once command received, send out action to the output pins
*Send the current action as a message to the controller
*Use flag to indicate if the action has been done, so we don't get
